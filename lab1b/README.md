## Lab 1B - Data Representation in C

### Learning Objectives
- Extract useful information from data using bitmasks and bitwise operators.
- Recognize differences in C data types and use C casting.
- Explain the relationship between pointers and arrays in C and use it to access and manipulate data.

### Format
This lab uses a custom data representation of aisles in a store. `aisle_manager.c` and `store_client.c` have skeleton functions for you to implement, each with a comment describing its desired behavior.

You will start by implementing functions that use bitwise operators, bitmasks, and C control structures to manage an individual **aisle**. After implementing these functions, you will move onto functions that use pointers, arrays, and your aisle functions to manage multiple aisles in a **store**.
