## Lab 1A - Pointers in C

### Learning Objectives
- Describe what a pointer is and use them to manipulate data.
- Use pointer arithmetic to perform address manipulations and access data.
- Describe the relationship between pointers and arrays.
- Use C casting to switch between different pointer types to make use of the different data type sizes.

### Format
`pointer.c` contains a skeleton for some programming puzzles, along with a comment block that describes exactly what the functions must do and what restrictions there are on their implementation. Your assignment is to complete each function skeleton according to the following rules:

- Only straightline code (i.e., no loops or conditionals) unless otherwise stated. Look for "Control Constructs" under ALLOWED in pointer.c comments.
- A limited number of C arithmetic and logical operators (described in pointer.c comments).
- The C bit shift operators (<< and >>) may be needed for some problems but will not be covered in lecture until next Wednesday.
- No constants larger than 8 bits (i.e., 0 - 255 inclusive) are allowed.
- Feel free to use "(", ")", and "=" as much as you want.
- You are permitted to use casts for these functions.
- We will not grade comments, but commenting your code is good practice and helpful for debugging.
