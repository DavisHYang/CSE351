## Lab 2 - Disassembling and Defusing a Binary Bomb

### Learning Objectives
- Given x86-64 assembly instructions, students are able to understand how they work together to form higher-level language constructs (comparison, loops, switch statements, recursion, pointers, and arrays).
- Describe the operations of basic x86-64 assembly instructions (jmp, add, mul, mov, lea, etc.). Students should know what the x86-64 size modifiers are, and know how memory addressing syntax works.
- Given a program, students are able to run a program with the `gdb` debugger and know how to step through the program, print values, set breakpoints, and rerun the program with different arguments.

### Format
- Your job is to find the correct strings to defuse the bomb. To avoid detonating the bomb, you will need to learn how to set breakpoints and single-step through the assembly code in `gdb` (our debugger) while inspecting the current state of the registers and memory.
